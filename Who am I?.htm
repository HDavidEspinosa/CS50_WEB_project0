      <h2>BIO</h2>
      <p>My name is Hernan David Espinosa. I am I PhD student in Melbourne, Australia. Originally, I am from Colombia. I studied music on the hopes of becoming a producer, which resulted in me becoming a Sound Design and Audio Editing teacher. This in turn got me to get my MA in screenwriting to become a creator… which got me really interested in stories. This led me to teaching and studying …hmmmm… everything! As part of a communications faculty I started studying everything about telling stories in our time. Which is a huge subject I love getting lost into. But to narrow it a bit I focus on:</p>
      <dl>
        <dt>Game Studies / Game Design</dt>
        <dd>I know they are not the same, but I can’t have one without the other</dd>
        <dt>Transmedia Storytelling</dt>
        <dd>This is so big here I’ll let super Jenkins -aka the original aca-fan- attempt to define it</dd>
        <dt>Flows and Counter-Flows</dt>
        <dd>In the world of convergence me and my mentor -Enrique Uribe- have been sort-of-fascinated by how content reaches people</dd>
        <dt>AI and Games</dt>
        <dd>This is the BIGGY right now. I started my PhD less than a year ago and this is where I am</dd>
